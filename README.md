# ðŸ§  Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Prediction

This project applies **Data Science and Machine Learning** techniques to predict the presence of Parkinsonâ€™s disease based on biomedical voice measurements. The dataset contains various voice features, and the target variable `status` indicates whether a person is healthy (`0`) or has Parkinsonâ€™s disease (`1`).

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Performed **data preprocessing** (cleaning, EDA, handling outliers, correlation analysis).
- Explored multiple **machine learning models**:
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - AdaBoost  
- Evaluated models using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**.
- Visualized key insights with **Seaborn and Matplotlib**.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- Source: `parkinsons.csv`  
- Rows: 195  
- Features: 24 (including biomedical voice features like `MDVP:Fo(Hz)`, `PPE`, `spread1`, etc.)
- Target: `status`  
  - `0` â†’ Healthy  
  - `1` â†’ Parkinsonâ€™s disease

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Random Forest performed the best, with the least misclassifications.
- Feature importance analysis showed which voice features most influenced predictions.
- Compared models using confusion matrix, accuracy, and F1-score.

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
- Try advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or SVM.
- Implement cross-validation for more robust results.
- Build a Flask or FastAPI web app for real-time prediction.
